ðŸš€ Built My First Interactive Webpage!
I recently created a basic personal webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal was to practice structuring a webpage, styling it, and adding simple interactivity.

ðŸ”§ What I Learned:
How to build and style a webpage using HTML & CSS

Centering content using Flexbox

Adding animations and hover effects

Using JavaScript to make the page interactive (button alerts, smooth scrolling, background color changes)

Integrating a library like Typed.js for typewriter-style text effects

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of front-end development, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and building more!
